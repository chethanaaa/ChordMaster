Computer vision is an extraordinary field that captivates my imagination and aligns perfectly with my interests in artificial intelligence and robotics. The concept of enabling machines to see, interpret and understand the visual world as humans do is both thrilling and transformative.
One of the most compelling aspects of computer vision is its wide range of applications. From facial recognition technology used in smartphones and security systems to augmented reality applications that enhance our interaction with the digital world, CV is making our lives more convenient and secure. The ability to seamlessly integrate visual data into these technologies showcases the versatility and potential of computer vision.
These applications highlight why I am so passionate about computer vision and its future. My interest in autonomous navigation, particularly for drones, is driven by the desire to explore how CV can enable machines to understand and interact with their surroundings autonomously. The prospect of developing intelligent systems that can navigate, make decisions and perform tasks without human intervention is incredibly exciting.

Project Description

The objective of my project, ChordMaster, is to create an innovative tool that leverages computer vision and machine learning to enhance the guitar learning experience. This project integrates several techniques from image processing and real-time video analysis to develop a system capable of recognizing and displaying guitar chords in real-time. Through this project, I have aimed to bridge the gap between traditional music learning and modern technology, providing amateur guitarists like me with a more intuitive and interactive method of receiving feedback on their playing. By developing a system that can detect guitar frets and recognize chords in real-time, I aim to provide immediate feedback on hand positions and chord formations, facilitating a more interactive and efficient learning process.
At a high level, ChordMaster captures video input of a guitar and the player’s hand positions, processes the images to detect the fretboard, and utilizes a convolutional neural network to recognize various chords based on finger placements. The system then displays the detected chords on the screen, offering real-time visual feedback.
In addition to chord and fret detection, the project includes a jigsaw puzzle module. This component uses sophisticated visual features to reconstruct images of my guitar from scattered pieces, showcasing the power and flexibility of image processing techniques. These two components of my project, ChordMaster for fret and chord detection and the jigsaw puzzle module, work together to enhance my understanding and application of computer vision in real-world scenarios, making learning both interactive and fun.

Problem Statement

As an amateur guitarist, I often find it challenging to ensure that my hand positions and chord formations are correct, especially when learning new songs. Traditional methods of learning chords from books or static diagrams can be cumbersome and do not provide real-time feedback. This is where my project, ChordMaster, comes into play.
ChordMaster is designed to detect guitar frets and chords in real-time using computer vision techniques. The fret detection system uses edge detection and contour formation to accurately identify the fretboard, while the chord detection system employs a convolutional neural network to recognize the chords based on finger positions. This real-time feedback helps me and other guitar enthusiasts correct our hand positions instantly, improving our learning experience.
In addition to chord detection, I also explored another intriguing application of computer vision: solving jigsaw puzzles. The puzzle-solving aspect of the project involves using image processing techniques to identify and match puzzle pieces based on their distinctive features. This project not only demonstrates the versatility of computer vision but also provides a fun and interactive way to apply the concepts learned in this course.

Implementation
Fret Detection Implementation
The fret detection implementation involves several steps that leverage image processing and computer vision techniques to identify and outline the fretboard on a guitar.
Image Acquisition and Conversion:
I utilized a webcam to capture real-time video input of the guitar. The process is started by capturing real-time video input using a webcam. I used OpenCV’s VideoCapture method to access the webcam and capture video frames.
Each frame was processed individually to detect the fretboard and hand positions. The captured image is then converted to grayscale using the cv2.cvtColor function. Grayscale conversion is crucial because it simplifies the image, reducing computational complexity while retaining essential structural information. It minimizes noise and improves the accuracy of edge detection.
Gaussian Blur:
Gaussian Blur is a technique used to reduce image noise and detail. It works by applying a Gaussian function, which results in a weighted average of the surrounding pixels to each pixel in the image. This has the effect of smoothing the image and is particularly useful in preprocessing steps for edge detection. This is applied to the grayscale image using cv2.GaussianBlur. This helps in suppressing noise and minor variations that could interfere with edge detection.
Canny Edge Detection:
The Canny Edge Detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. The Canny edge detector is then applied to the blurred image using cv2.Canny. Canny edge detection is a multi-stage algorithm that detects a wide range of edges in images. It involves gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, double thresholding and edge tracking by hysteresis. This technique is chosen because it effectively detects sharp discontinuities in intensity, which correspond to edges in the image, such as the boundaries of the fretboard. This step was crucial for highlighting the boundaries of the fretboard.
Contour Detection:
A contour is a curve joining all the continuous points along a boundary with the same color or intensity. Contours are useful for shape analysis and object detection and recognition. Contours are detected in the edge-detected image using cv2.findContours. Contours represent the boundaries of objects in an image. In this context, they help identify the outline of the fretboard. The largest contour by area is assumed to be the fretboard, which is then drawn on the original image using cv2.drawContours.
Fretboard Outline Calculation:
The coordinates of the contour points are extracted to determine the outline of the fretboard. The minimum and maximum x-coordinates help in identifying the horizontal bounds of the fretboard, while the maximum y-coordinate gives the vertical bound. This information is used to visualize the fretboard's position and dimensions.

Figure 2: Detected Fretboard Lines
Hand Position Detection:
MediaPipe is a framework developed by Google and provides tools for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition. Landmarks are specific points of interest on an object that can be used to understand its shape and position. In the context of hand tracking, landmarks are key points on the hand, such as fingertips and joints. MediaPipe identifies 21 landmarks on each hand, which include key points like the tips of the fingers, joints, and the wrist. These landmarks help in understanding the pose and movement of the hand. 

Figure 3: MediaPipe Hand Landmarks
Using MediaPipe’s hand detection module, I detected hand landmarks in the video frame. Each frame captured from the webcam is processed. The frame is converted to RGB format, as MediaPipe processes images in RGB. The Hands object is created with specific detection and tracking confidence levels. The Hands object processes the RGB frame to detect hand landmarks. If hand landmarks are detected, they are processed further.
The bounding box for the detected hand was drawn, and the position of the hand relative to the fretboard was calculated. The bounding box around the hand is calculated by finding the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the landmarks. This bounding box is drawn on the image to visualize the hand's position relative to the fretboard.
The distance between the hand and the fretboard's starting position is calculated to determine which fret is being played. This distance is compared against predefined thresholds to identify the specific fret, which is then displayed on the screen.
The processed frame is displayed with the bounding box and fret number using OpenCV's imshow function.
The process continues in a loop, capturing and processing frames until the user quits the program.
The parameters that I used in this section after trial and error finally are as follows:
Gaussian Blur Kernel Size: (5, 5)
Canny Edge Detector Thresholds: 50 and 150
Bounding Box Color: (0, 255, 0)
Minimum Detection Confidence for MediaPipe Hands: 0.5
Minimum Tracking Confidence for MediaPipe Hands: 0.5
Chord Detection Implementation
Chord detection involves capturing images of different chords, training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize these chords and then using the trained model for real-time chord recognition.
Image Capture and Preprocessing:
I captured images of various chords played on the guitar using a webcam.
These images were saved in separate directories for each chord type. For each frame, the fretboard outline and hand landmarks are detected. The frame is saved if the user presses a specific key.
The images are saved in designated directories for each chord.
The captured images were preprocessed similarly to the fret detection images, involving grayscale conversion and edge detection. Edges are then detected using the Canny edge detector to highlight the contours of the fingers pressing the strings and the fretboard outline.
Contour and Line Detection:
Contours are detected in the edge-detected image to identify the outline of the fretboard. Additionally, lines on the fretboard are detected using two techniques: Line Segment Detector (LSD) and Hough Transform.
The Hough Transform is a feature extraction technique used in image analysis. It is used to find imperfect instances of objects within a certain class of shapes by a voting procedure. The classical Hough Transform is most commonly used for detecting regular shapes like lines and circles.
LSD detects line segments in the image by fitting line models to edge points, while Hough Transform detects lines by transforming edge points to a parameter space and finding accumulations that represent lines. Both methods are used to ensure robust detection of fretboard lines, which are essential for accurate chord recognition.
Model Training:
Captured images of each chord are stored in designated directories. The dataset comprised 772 images for training, 48 images for validation, and 138 images for testing, each belonging to six different classes/chords (A Major, C Major, D Major, E Minor, F Major and G Major). The dataset was balanced with 128 images per class to ensure uniform training across all chord classes.
A CNN is trained on these images to learn the visual patterns associated with each chord. The CNN architecture includes several layers: convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling layers for down-sampling and dense layers for classification.
Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, shifting and zooming, are applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization ability. The ImageDataGenerator class is used to augment the training and validation images. This includes operations like rescaling, rotation, width/height shift, shear, zoom, and horizontal flip.
It is also used to create training, validation, and test data generators from the directory structure. 
The model was trained on the augmented images to classify different chords accurately. 
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Class balancing is ensured by limiting the number of images per class to the minimum available images in any class.
The model is trained using the balanced dataset with callbacks to save the best model based on validation accuracy.
Chord Prediction:
In real-time chord detection, the input image is preprocessed by resizing, normalizing pixel values and expanding dimensions to match the input shape expected by the CNN.
The preprocessed image is passed through the trained CNN, which outputs a probability distribution over the chord classes. The chord with the highest probability is selected as the predicted chord.
Class indices are loaded from a pickle file to map model predictions to chord names. The predicted chord is displayed on the screen, providing immediate feedback to the user.
The parameters after trial and error that I used to train my model in this section finally are as follows:

Jigsaw Puzzle Implementation
The jigsaw puzzle assembly section involves detecting and matching features of puzzle pieces to reassemble the complete image.
I captured the image of my guitar using a camera and constructed puzzle pieces out of it using an online puzzle creation software.

Figure 4: Jigsaw Puzzle Pieces
The Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm is used to detect keypoints and compute descriptors for each puzzle piece. SIFT is robust to changes in scale, rotation, and illumination, making it ideal for identifying distinctive features in puzzle pieces. Keypoints represent unique patterns in the image and descriptors are vectors that describe the local appearance around each keypoint.
The Brute Force matcher is used to find correspondences between the descriptors of different puzzle pieces. The BF matcher compares each descriptor from one piece with all descriptors from another piece and finds the best matches based on a distance metric. Good matches indicate that the corresponding keypoints on the two pieces have similar local appearances, suggesting that the pieces fit together.
Once matching keypoints are identified, a homography transformation is estimated to align the pieces. Homography is a projective transformation that maps points from one plane to another. It is used to warp one puzzle piece to fit with another based on the matched keypoints. The transformation is computed using methods like RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) to ensure robustness against outliers.
The puzzle pieces are transformed and aligned using the estimated homography transformations. The assembled pieces are then combined to reconstruct the complete image. The process is repeated for all pieces until the entire puzzle is reassembled, demonstrating the power of computer vision techniques in solving complex real-world problems.

Analysis
FRET DETECTION
The fret detection system utilized a combination of edge detection, contour detection, and hand landmark detection techniques. The results demonstrated that the system could accurately identify the fret positions on the guitar fretboard. Here's a detailed analysis of the system:
Edge Detection: The use of the Canny edge detector was effective in identifying prominent edges within the grayscale image of the guitar. The Canny edge detector is particularly well-suited for detecting sharp changes in intensity, making it ideal for identifying the boundaries of the fretboard.
Contour Detection: The contours identified by the system were processed to find the largest contour, which was assumed to be the fretboard. This assumption was validated by drawing the contour on the original image, confirming the accuracy of the detection. The contour detection algorithm effectively segmented the fretboard from the rest of the image, even in varying lighting conditions.
Hand Landmark Detection: The MediaPipe framework provided accurate hand landmarks, which were used to calculate the bounding box around the hand. This step was crucial in determining the hand's position relative to the fretboard.
Fret Identification: By comparing the bounding box coordinates with the fretboard outline, the system could determine the specific fret where the hand or finger was placed. This comparison was made by calculating the distance between the bounding box and the fretboard outline, ensuring precise fret identification.
Technical Challenges and Solutions: The main challenge was to ensure the robustness of the edge and contour detection under different lighting conditions and backgrounds. Gaussian Blur helped in reducing noise and the Canny edge detector parameters were fine-tuned to achieve optimal results. The system's ability to adapt to different hand positions and angles was enhanced by using a flexible bounding box calculation based on hand landmarks.
CHORD DETECTION TRAINING
Balanced Dataset: The dataset was balanced with an equal number of images per class (128 images per chord). This balancing was crucial to prevent the model from being biased towards any particular chord, ensuring uniform training and accurate recognition across all chords.
Data Augmentation: The use of data augmentation techniques enriched the dataset, making the model more robust to variations in chord representation.
CNN Architecture: The CNN model, with multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers, was well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture effectively captured the spatial hierarchies in the chord images.
Overfitting Management: The model was trained with regularization techniques such as Dropout to prevent overfitting. The high validation and test accuracies indicated that the model generalized well beyond the training data. The loss and accuracy trends during the training process were consistent, showing steady improvements over epochs. The occasional spikes in validation loss were managed by using the ModelCheckpoint callback to save the best-performing model.
CHORD DETECTION IN REAL-TIME
Error Handling: The system appropriately handled cases where the guitar was not detected or no chord was played, displaying relevant messages. This feature added robustness to the system, ensuring reliable performance in varying conditions.
The real-time performance of the system was optimized to ensure minimal latency, providing immediate feedback to the user. The use of efficient image processing techniques and a well-trained CNN model contributed to this performance.
In conclusion, the results from the three components of the project - fret detection, chord detection training and real-time chord detection, demonstrated the effectiveness of advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques in creating an interactive and responsive guitar chord recognition system. The technical challenges were addressed through careful design and implementation, resulting in a robust and accurate solution.
AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

Fine-tuning the model parameters and experimenting with different architectures could potentially improve the validation and test accuracies even further.
Enhancing the smoothing algorithm for detections to reduce flickering and improve stability in chord predictions.
The Jigsaw Puzzle Solver project aimed to develop an algorithm capable of reconstructing a jigsaw puzzle from an image of its disassembled pieces. The results demonstrated significant progress in achieving this goal. The implemented solution successfully identified and segmented individual puzzle pieces using edge detection and contour detection techniques. These pieces were then processed to identify their boundary characteristics, enabling the matching of edges based on shape and color.
The algorithm effectively reconstructed puzzles with a high degree of accuracy when tested on various images. For simpler puzzles with fewer pieces and distinct edge features, the algorithm achieved near-perfect reconstruction. More complex puzzles with intricate patterns and larger numbers of pieces presented greater challenges but still showed promising results. The performance was evaluated based on the accuracy of piece placement and the overall time taken for reconstruction.
Analysis
The analysis of the Jigsaw Puzzle Solver project reveals several insights into the effectiveness and limitations of the approach used. The edge detection and contour detection techniques proved to be robust for segmenting puzzle pieces from the background. However, the accuracy of segmentation was highly dependent on the quality of the input image and the distinctness of the edges.
The algorithm's ability to match pieces based on boundary characteristics showcased the potential of shape and color analysis in solving jigsaw puzzles. The use of features such as edge orientation and color histograms enabled effective matching, although it was observed that variations in lighting and shadows could impact the results.
In terms of computational efficiency, the algorithm performed well for smaller puzzles but exhibited increased processing times for puzzles with a larger number of pieces. This highlights the need for optimization and potentially parallel processing techniques to handle more complex puzzles efficiently.
Overall, the Jigsaw Puzzle Solver project demonstrated the feasibility of using computer vision techniques for puzzle reconstruction. The results indicate that with further refinement and optimization, the algorithm could be adapted for real-world applications, such as automated puzzle solving and aiding in archaeological artifact reconstruction.
